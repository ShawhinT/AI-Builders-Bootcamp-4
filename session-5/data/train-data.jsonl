Crop these images so that they are 1024x1024 (using Python).\n\nStep 2: Generate Captions\n\nUse a visual language model (e.g. Llava 13B) to write captions for each photo automatically. Be sure to include a unique \"trigger token\" in each caption, which the model can learn to associate with your face.\n\nStep 3: Fine-tune the Model\n\nUpload a .zip file containing your image-caption pairs to this\u00a0training endpoint\u00a0via the Replicate API (or the web UI).\n\nStep 4: Use the Model\n\nAfter ~10 min and ~$1 for training, a model playground will spin up on Replicate, from which you can generate images from the model.\n\nI walk through this whole process in a recent blog post.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Check it out: https://lnkd.in/giYp7VFx\n\nHere are some of my favorites \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\n--\nMedia: Image"}]}

In other words, you can make 2X your corporate salary as an independent, but also you can make 1/2 of it.\n\nFreedom \ud83e\udd85 \n\nFreelancing has a corporate beat on this one. \n\nAs a freelancer, you have complete control over what projects you take on and when/where you work.\n\nUncertainty \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab \n\nBroadly speaking, corporate has freelancing beat on this one (especially in the early days). However, there\u2019s a nuance here. \n\nCorporate gives a strong perception of stability, so when something eventually DOES go wrong, it can be devastating. \n\nWhile for freelance, instability is the norm, so freelancers become much more resilient toward it.\n\nLearning \ud83e\udd13 \n\nBoth settings have great learning opportunities. In my experience, however, these have different flavors. \n\nIn corporate, learning can be optional given the coverage of other team members and lean more toward technical skills. \n\nOn the other hand, freelance can be very much \u201dlearn or die,\u201d which makes it more powerful, IMO.\n\n\nHow do you compare these two work environments?\n\n--\nMedia: Image"}]}
