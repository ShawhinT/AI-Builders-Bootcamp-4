3 types of AI Tik Tok,"A problem with AI today is that it means different things to different people. 

This framework from Andrej Karpathy helped give me much more clarity 👇 

Software 1.0 = Rule-based software systems. Humans program computers to solve problems step-by-step. 

Software 2.0 = Computers program themselves by seeing examples (i.e. machine learning) 

Software 3.0 = Repurposing general-purpose ML models for specific use cases (i.e. GenAI + Foundation Models)

Using polars for the first time,"I finally found an excuse to try polars (thanks to Ben for showing me the light). 

For the uninitiated, polars is essentially a (much) faster version of pandas. 🐻‍❄️ > 🐼 

After using it for a recent project, here are 3 things I liked about it 👇 

1) The Syntax 

Most of the syntax is identical to pandas, which made it super easy to use without any tutorials. 
2) The “Lazy” API This allows you to manipulate dataframes without loading them into memory. 

At the end, you can perform all the operations via the .collect() method. 
3) .scan_parquet() 

Yes, you can import .parquet files in pandas, but when combined with the Lazy API, this allows you to locally work with 10X bigger datasets in polars than pandas",Code,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shawhintalebi_i-finally-found-an-excuse-to-try-polars-activity-7193972707175116800-kofh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

Communication challenges for data scientist. Promote blog post,"This is why data scientists don’t get promoted (hint: It’s not SWE) 👇 

A universal challenge for data scientists is communicating effectively with non-technical stakeholders. 

This was one of the biggest limiting factors for those seeking advancement when I worked at a larger enterprise. 

Here are 3 Communication tips that helped me get ahead as a data scientist. 

1) Use Stories—framing communication as 3-part narrative helps it go down easier e.g. status quo, problem, solution. 

2) Use Examples—examples make abstract ideas concrete. For instance, a 3-part narrative was used in this post. 

3) Use analogies—analogies help us learn new things by mapping the unfamiliar to the familiar, which is very handy when explaining technical ideas.

Challenges of fine-tuning on Mac. Promote YouTube video,"Nvidia is making it not a great time to be a Mac user... 

While fine-tuning ML models has never been easier, most of the open-source tooling is built for Nvidia hardware.

Mistake from previous fine-tuning blog and sharing new one,"Last year, I wrote a popular blog on fine-tuning LLMs with example code. 

There was only one problem… my fine-tuned model was overfitting 🤦🏻‍♂️ 

While it doesn't feel so good to be wrong publicly (32k people read that article), it's one of the best ways to learn. 

Public mistakes are great motivators for improvement and are an effective way of internalizing lessons. 

One year later, I’ve (finally) redeemed myself by sharing another fine-tuning example (that doesn’t overfit).

Sharing blog post on QLoRA,"Fine-tuning is when we take an existing model and tweak it for a specific use case 🔧

Although this is a simple (and powerful) idea, applying it to LLMs isn’t always straightforward. 

The key challenge is that LLMs are (very) computationally expensive e.g. full fine-tuning of a 70B parameter model requires over 1TB of memory!

Sharing Python Quickstart blog post,"Learning Python is one of the best decisions I’ve made for my career. 

And for those trying to get into AI and machine learning… it’s (basically) a requirement. 

However, if you’re new to programming, it can be hard to know where to start. 

That’s why I recently shared a beginner’s guide to AI development with Python.

Lessons from mentorship call with $100k/mo entrepreneur,"Last month, I booked my most expensive mentorship call yet at $700/hr 😬 

While this might sound like a big number, the person on the other side of the call makes $100k/mo as a solo AI entrepreneur. 

Here are my key takeaways from this conversation... 

1) Focus on customer pain points and problems, not your past experience and skills. 

2) Price for the customer's value, not your time. 

3) The bigger the price tag, the longer the copy (i.e. delay the ask) 

4) Get hyper-clear on the customer and their problem, then attract them with free content (on socials) and a lead magnet. 

5) The difference between 10k/mo and 100k/mo is more often business strategy rather than technical expertise. 

Although these points might be Business 101 for some, many technical founders (like me) never learned these basics. 

This is great news because it means I can probably get significant gains from a few simple adjustments.

Quitting consoling to focus on content creation,"I’m quitting consulting to focus on YouTube. 

Here’s why. 👇 

1) YouTube is working! (80% of my traffic comes from YT) 

2) It allows me to focus on one thing (i.e. avoid distractions) 

3) Making 1 video a week gives me a clear, quantifiable goal that I can use to frame my learning and product development. 

While committing to one thing is scary (especially something unpredictable like YouTube 😅), it is also necessary for success. 

The reason (IMO) is that commitment backs you into a corner, forcing you to innovate and learn new things.

Evolution of OCR and sharing YouTube video on multimodal AI,"5 years ago, sentiment analysis and OCR required specialized ML skills. 

Today, however, these are trivially done by off-the-shelf AI systems... 

Models like GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.2 Vision can seamlessly process text and image data. 

This combination is important because text inputs provide users with an interface to readily adapt the model's behavior to endless NLP and CV tasks. 

For example, reading scanned invoices, defect detection, chart analysis, coding apps based on design mockups, visual question answering, and much more.

3 ways to make LLMs multimodal and sharing blog post,"Over the past year, we’ve seen LLMs gain the ability to see (i.e. process images) and hear (i.e. process audio directly), but how does that work under the hood?

1. LLM + Tools: Augment LLMs with pre-built components 

2. LLM + Adapters: Augment LLMs with multi-modal encoders or decoders, which are aligned via adapter fine-tuning 

3. Unified Models: Expand LLM architecture to fuse modalities at pre-training

Importance of deploying ML models and a simple way to do it. Share blog post,"Although it may seem that machine learning is all about training fancy models, in the real world, a model (by itself) does NOT generate value. 

To turn an ML model into an ML solution (i.e., something valuable), we must “deploy it.” 

While this can take many different forms, there is a simple 3-step strategy that works well in many situations…

Step 1: Create an inference API 

Step 2: Containerize the API

Lessons from 13 months of entrepreneurship,"It’s been 13 months since I had a W2 job... 

During this time, I’ve realized there are several popular misconceptions about entrepreneurship. 

Here are a few that are top of mind for me right now 👇 

❌ ""I need funding to build a business."" 
✅ The vast majority of businesses take no outside funding, and <1% take VC. Figuring out how to survive IS the game. 

❌ ""I need an idea that can scale well."" 
✅ ”Do things that don’t scale” -Paul Graham. There’s no point in scaling something no one wants. IF demand exists, then there’s always a way to scale. 

❌ ""I need to learn web development frameworks to build a SaaS product.""

Advice for data people thinking of pursuing entrepreneurship,"Last year, I passed on a $150k data science promotion to pursue my entrepreneurial dream life. Here’s my honest advice for data people considering a similar transition 👇 

1) Start with a side hustle 

Making money as an entrepreneur is very different than getting a paycheck. A side hustle is a great, low-stakes way to develop the necessary skillset. 

The way I got started was through content creation and freelancing. 

2) Learn how to sell 

Data people typically have high-value skills like programming, data analytics, and machine learning. However, having these skills is not sufficient for monetizing them. 

For that, you need to figure out how to sell yourself and your offers. 

3) Shift your mindset from “What job can I do?” to “What problems can I solve?” 

This is one of the biggest mindset shifts I’ve had to make this past year. 

Focusing on fulfilling a role means you will always need someone's permission to get paid (whether a manager or a client). 

However, when you focus on solving problems, there are very few constraints on how you can generate value, so you can make a living on your terms.",Image,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shawhintalebi_last-year-i-passed-on-a-150k-data-science-activity-7255216987381903360-NKvI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
3 habits I had to break to become a senior data scientist,"Here are 3 habits I had to BREAK before becoming a Senior Data Scientist 👇 

1) Not digging deeper ❌ 

Something that took me too long to learn was the importance of asking “why?” and digging more deeply into a request to find the underlying problem. 

2) Focusing on technologies instead of problems ❌ 

As a technical person, I found it easy to get so caught up in fancy new technologies that the problem we were trying to solve took a back seat. 

3) Seeking sophistication ❌ 

My favorite part of data science is combining techniques in creative ways to solve problems. 

However, this can lead to overly sophisticated solutions that can often be replaced by simpler ones while still capturing the value.

How to build client relationships as a data scientist,"To be an effective data scientist focus on relationships, not technologies. 

While data science requires a minimum amount of technical proficiency, this isn’t the usual bottleneck for a data team’s impact 💥 

The more I’ve worked with clients on business use cases, the more I’ve realized how a shallow relationship and lack of trust can hinder a data project’s impact. 

Here are 3 things I do to cultivate a new client relationship 👇 

1) Be curious (about the problem and where the other side is coming from)

Lesson from posting 1 Youtube video a week,"Last quarter, I did an experiment where I posted 1 YouTube video every week. 

... it did not go as expected 😬 

My Hypothesis—Since YouTube drives 80% of my inbound traffic (e.g., paid calls, speaking gigs, project opportunities), doubling my video output will double my business. 

The Results—Almost every business metric went down e.g. number of paid calls, number of leads, subscribers per month, YT revenue per month 😅 

So what happened? 

My (current) guesses: 

- No LLM videos (these are among my most popular) 
- Less time per video diminished quality 
- I spent too much time making content and not enough time talking to clients and other folks working in the space (i.e. I got out of touch) 

That’s why this quarter, I’ll be scaling back my content quantity and focusing more on quality by… 

- Lowering my monthly YT video goal to 3 per month 
- Lowering my consultation rates (so I can stay connected with people’s needs) 
- Doing more project work as an intellectual break from making videos",Image,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shawhintalebi_last-quarter-i-did-an-experiment-where-i-activity-7213623619136933888-9wwE?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

5. AI Workshop 
6. Referral 
7. Buy Me a Coffee

Lessons from talking to 15 data science freelancers,"After talking to 15 data science freelancers, this was one of my biggest takeaways 👇 

Learn the full tech stack. 

When doing data science work as a freelancer, one is often working alone 👨🏻‍💻 

This means that generating real-world value from a data science project is going to require you to go outside the typical data science skillset. 

Toward that end, my goal this quarter is to sit down with 4 data engineers and 4 ML engineers to get guidance on how I can learn the full DS tech stack.

Takeaways from Q1 retreat,"This past week my fiancé and I did a “work retreat” to set our goals for Q1. 

Changing our environment helps us break out of the routines of last quarter, which I’ve found super helpful for strategic thinking 🧠 

My key takeaway from this is I need to “do more doing”. 

This means prioritizing practice over theory, building over thinking, and focus over meandering. 

Toward that end, a major focus for me this quarter is to expand my technical skills and become a “full-stack data scientist” 👨🏻‍💻 

Here are 3 goals in that direction 👇 

1) Chat with 4 data engineers and 4 ML engineers 

2) Build (practical) projects using Docker, AWS, and Git 

3) Do 1 end-to-end DS project

"Why entrepreneurs shouldn’t quit, showcasing data and Lindy principle","You often hear entrepreneurs say, “keep going” or “just don’t quit” 

Here’s (statistically) why this is good advice 👇 

The 1st plot below shows business survival rates est in 1994 up until 2023 

This demonstrates the low odds of entrepreneurial success, with 50% closing after 5 years. 

However, something interesting happens if we look at this same curve for businesses that have been around for a few years (2nd plot). 

Here, we see the curve incrementally move up the longer a business stays alive. 

In other words, their probability of survival increases the longer they survive 📈 

For example, although only 50% of new businesses make it to year 5, these odds jump to 57% after just 1 year in business!

Getting a data science job was hard until I learned these 5 things,"Getting a Data Science Job was hard until I learned these 5 things 👇 

1. Adapt your resume to the specific role 

You have about 7 seconds of a hiring manager's attention when reviewing your resume; use it to call out all the skills they listed in the job description. 

2. Do real-world projects 

While toy projects from class or Kaggle are a great way to learn, hiring managers care about real-world impact. 

3. Make a portfolio 

Despite the free no-code tools for making a portfolio website, most people don't make one. That makes this a super easy way to stand out. 

4. Stay out of the weeds (unless they ask) 

This was one of my greatest struggles. When someone asked about a project, I would dive right into the technical details. 

This is the best way to lose someone's attention (even data scientists). 

5. Be yourself (not who you think they want to hire) 

When I interviewed for my full-time data science role, I dove into a rant about my love for optimization. 

Most people get confused and awkward when I discuss such topics, but not the interviewers. They got pumped up... that's when I knew I found my people 😁

Over the past year, I’ve seen a trend of CEOs and founders scrambling to find AI use cases for their businesses. 

While this AI excitement is great for data scientists like me, it is not sufficient for value generation. 

In other words, “using AI” won’t necessarily move the needle on the things important to businesses.

Don’t build a chatbot and 5 LLM use case ideas.,"Don’t use AI to build a chatbot 🤖 

❌ Although ChatGPT (and friends) has captured the world’s imagination regarding AI, the business value of building an ""AI chatbot"" may not justify the cost. 

Here are 5 better LLM use cases for business 👇 

1) Structure unstructured data—format data from inconvenient sources into a structured database 

2) Standardize data—resolve conflicts between databases and make it analytics-ready 

3) Data augmentation—enrich existing datasets with meta-tags and other information

Here are 10 common AI terms every practitioner should know... 

1) RAG = automatically providing relevant context (i.e. docs) to an AI system so it can generate better responses
2) Vector DB = numerical representations of documents which can be used for RAG and search 
3) Fine-tuning = adapting a model to a particular use case through additional training 
4) AI Agent = an AI system that can plan and execute tasks 
5) Evals = tests that score an AI system’s efficacy 
6) Hallucination = a ""made-up"" response from an AI that sounds reasonable 
7) Multimodal = data of different formats (e.g. text, images, audio, videos, tables, time series) 
8) Small Language Models = LLMs with ~1B parameters 
9) Quantization = reducing the precision of model parameters to reduce its size 
10) Distillation = using a large model to train a smaller one

What does a data scientist (actually) do? Share Tik Tok,"12 years ago, “Data Scientist” was the sexiest job of the century. 

Today, it’s still an in-demand role, offering cushy salaries… 

But what do they actually do? 

In my view, the main job of a data scientist is to answer questions using data. 

This consists of 4 key activities 👇 

1) Have a question to answer—this typically comes from clients and business stakeholders. 

2) Acquiring the relevant data—this is the boring yet most important part. 

3) Analyzing data—once the data are in a usable form, data scientists use tools like Python or R to compute statistics and create data visualizations.

Libs: sentence_transformers, sklearn 

4. Multimodal Semantic Search (Intermediate) 🔍 

Searching text is easy… but what about videos and images? Now, you can use multimodal embedding models to embed text and images in the same space for search. 

Libs: transformers Model: nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5 

5. Desktop QA (Advanced) 💬 

You can connect a multimodal knowledge base to a model like Llama-3.2-11B-Vision to do question-answering.

How I’d learn AI if I started over today.,"AI has changed a lot since I started 5 years ago. 

Here’s how I’d learn it if I had to start over… 

1. Learn Python 

Although some say you don’t need to learn to code anymore, I still think it’s essential for anyone who wants to build custom software solutions. 

2. Build Projects 

The AI space is too massive and evolving too quickly to effectively learn from a textbook. The best approach (IMO) is to start by building projects and learning concepts as needed. 

3. Start with Kaggle/HF Datasets 

While you’ll never find neatly curated data in the real world, I think using resources like Kaggle or Hugging Face is a great starting place for beginners. 

Some libraries worth learning for this initial project are: Pandas (or Polars), matplotlib, and sklearn 

4. Find a real-world project 

After one or two toy projects, it’s time to start working on something more practical. 

The best projects solve a real-world problem. I’d seek one out by reaching out to businesses or other orgs in my network to see if I could offer them free work. 

5. Use ChatGPT and Cursor

AI Roadmap for Entrepreneurs,"AI Roadmap for Entrepreneurs 👇
The 5 things you need to know to build your next AI app...
Use AI Tools
Moving fast means you make mistakes faster than your competition and ship something before you run out of runway.
Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc., are the best way to do that when it comes to learning and building.
Prompt Engineering
Learning how to write effective prompts not only helps you use AI tools better but also allows you to build better LLM systems.
There are a few universal tips you should know (e.g., give details, use structure, give examples), as well as model-specific ones you can find from the particular model provider.
RAG
While prompting alone can take you far, it falls short when your solution relies on specialized or user-specific information.
Having a basic understanding of retrieval (i.e. search) and how you can use it to improve LLM responses is central.
Tool-use & AI agents
We often don’t just want LLMs to process information for us, we want it to solve our problems.
This is where endowing models with the ability to perform actions (through tool use) will help.
Fine-tuning
Some use cases require changing an LLM’s behavior significantly. If prompting and other workarounds are not enough, fine-tuning is a viable option.
Additionally, this allows you to build specialized models for your specific use case, which can come with significant cost savings.

Technical debt slide screenshot from ABB4 session 1,"Building a software product is easier than ever.

But there’s a hidden cost to this…

Having an LLM code your entire application helps you move fast, but will incur technical debt.

Like financial debt, technical debt involves getting some benefit now (e.g., a finished app) while delaying the cost until later (e.g., learning how it works).

The other extreme is to code your app completely from scratch and only using the Python docs.

If you do this, you’ll understand every nook and cranny of your code base, but it will take you much longer 😅 

Therefore, an important skill developers must learn today is understanding how much technical debt to take on for a specific situation.

If speed now is the top priority, then more debt can be good.

If time later is more important, then less debt is better.

Corporate vs Freelance Data Science,"Corporate vs Freelance Data Science… My Honest Reflections.

As someone who has worked as a data scientist at a company and independently, here is how I’d compare the two.

Income 💸 

While the average income is probably about the same, the key difference is the income distribution. 

Corporate salaries are more normally distributed, while freelance income is more fat-tailed. In other words, you can make 2X your corporate salary as an independent, but also you can make 1/2 of it.

Freedom 🦅 

Freelancing has a corporate beat on this one. 

As a freelancer, you have complete control over what projects you take on and when/where you work.

Uncertainty 😵‍💫 

Broadly speaking, corporate has freelancing beat on this one (especially in the early days). However, there’s a nuance here. 

Corporate gives a strong perception of stability, so when something eventually DOES go wrong, it can be devastating. 

While for freelance, instability is the norm, so freelancers become much more resilient toward it.

Learning 🤓 

Both settings have great learning opportunities. In my experience, however, these have different flavors. 

In corporate, learning can be optional given the coverage of other team members and lean more toward technical skills. 

On the other hand, freelance can be very much ”learn or die,” which makes it more powerful, IMO.

Project share: resume optimizer,"By the end of this post, you’ll be able to build an AI-powered resume optimization tool (in 6 steps) 🔨

Step 1: Create a markdown version of your resume with the desired format of your final resume (Note: ChatGPT can do this for you).

Step 2: Read your markdown resume and job description into Python

Step 3: Craft a prompt that combines your resume, the job description, and instructions for creating a new resume in Markdown. 

Step 4: Use OpenAI’s Python API to prompt GPT-4o-mini to rewrite your resume.

Step 5: Convert the markdown output to HTML and then to PDF with the markdown and weasyprint libraries, respectively.

Step 6: Create a simple web UI to make it easy to upload new resumes and optimize them for new JDs

I've implemented this tool and shared the code for free on GitHub.

My Journey from 0 to 70k Followers,"My Journey from 0 to 70k Followers

There was never a master plan with my content creation...

I did it mainly because 1) it gave me a way to structure my learning and 2) it helped me to improve my communication (which was desperately needed 😅)

However, today, content creation is the main way I get customers and allows me to work for myself.

Here’s a recap of my journey (so far):
- Nov 2020: I post my first blog and YouTube video
- Jul 2021: I made my first $1 online (via Medium’s Partner’s Program)
- Oct 2021: I had my first $100 month
- May 2022: I graduated with my PhD and accepted a full-time data science role at Toyota
- Dec 2022: I hit 1,000 subs on YouTube
- Jul 2023: I joined YouTube’s Partner’s Program and quit my job (which were only loosely correlated)
- Jul 2024: I hit 10,000 subs on YouTube
- Feb 2025: I hit 50,000 subs on YouTube
- Today: I have over 70k followers across Medium and YouTube, which serve as my main lead source for my AI cohort.

While it’s easy to get enchanted by numbers and success stories, it’s important to remember it took me 4.5 years to get to this point (and most of my growth happened in just the last year).

So, if you’re still in the early days, keep going!

Employee to entrepreneur mindset shift,"In my first 12 months of entrepreneurship, I made 1/5th of my full-time salary.

But that all changed when I made this simple mindset shift.

When I quit my job to become an entrepreneur, I asked myself:

""What work can I do to make a living?”

Looking back, I realize this was the WRONG question. Instead, I should have asked: 

“What problems can I solve?”

While the difference may seem subtle, these are fundamentally different mindsets.

The first question is what I call the “employee mindset,” which focuses on the inputs you do that eventually generate value.

The second is what I call the “entrepreneur mindset,” which focuses on the outcomes you want to create for your customer.

In my first year of entrepreneurship, I had an employee’s mindset, which resulted in me working very, very hard just to make a fraction of my full-time income (basically minimum wage) 😅 

It wasn’t until I adopted an “entrepreneur mindset” that I could match my full-time salary.

So, if you are a new or aspiring entrepreneur, ask yourself…

Am I focused more on doing a job or solving a specific pain point?",Image,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shawhintalebi_in-my-first-12-months-of-entrepreneurship-activity-7310303023451279360-S8Zn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACFGuxYBcWQptyzduLudr2p_YeiWI085EQs

I love to learn by watching YouTube videos and reading books...

When it comes to developing AI skills, however, I've realized this is NOT enough.

Real skill development comes from one thing: building 🔨

That's why I created the AI Builders Bootcamp, a program where product builders can connect and learn from each other in a supportive community.

Here are some of the projects we've built in past cohorts:
1) AI Job Board Scraper
2) Interactive AI Job Dashboard
3) ML-based Email Categorizer
4) PDF Summarizer
5) (Local) Document QA Chatbot
6) Structuring Unstructured Survey Data
7) AI-powered Customer Segmentation
8) Semantic Search Over Blog Posts
9) RAG Chatbot Over Blog Series
10) Fine-tuning an LLM LinkedIn Post Writer
